Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

Example:

Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
             
Solution in python 2.7

class Solution(object):
    def addDigits(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        s=0
        while num>0:
            n=num
            s=0
            while n>0:
                s=s+(n%10)
                n=n/10
            num=s
            if (num/10==0):
                break
        return s
